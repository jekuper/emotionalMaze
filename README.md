## Algorithms used

### Procedural Generation of Labyrinths

One of the game's standout features is its customizable procedural generation of labyrinths. It utilizes a modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to create a dynamic and unique gaming experience for every player. This innovative approach ensures that no two playthroughs are the same, enhancing replayability and keeping players engaged as they unravel the emotional maze.
